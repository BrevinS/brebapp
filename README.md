Side project 
Flask SQL Alchemy web page intended for personal website and Machine learning techniques for .csv files
Currenty supports unsupervised algorithms Hierarchical Clustering, Kmeans Clustering and supervised learning algorithm just K-Nearest-Neighbors currently.

Working on adding a couple more algorithms specifically to supervised algorithms. Will then add ways to make data ordinal by allowing the use of One-Hot-Encoding and other techniques to change or add columns that are ML compatable. 

Sometimes public @ website "brevin.me" using AWS EC2 Connection and currently setting up CI/CD (9/5/2022)
